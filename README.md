# üíæ Logic Gate Simulator

This project is an interactive digital logic simulator built to explore the fundamental principles of how computers work. It provides a hands-on way to understand logic gates the basic building blocks of all digital circuits.

Inspired by the fantastic educational content from creators like Sebastian Lague, this playground allows you to build simple circuits by dragging, dropping, and connecting components. You can visually observe how binary logic (`1`s and `0`s) flows through the system in real-time, offering a clear and intuitive learning experience.

## üéØ Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to serve as an interactive learning tool for computer science fundamentals.

By providing a hands-on "playground," the objective is to bridge the gap between abstract theory and the practical application of binary logic.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Framework:** [React](https://react.dev/)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Rendering:** **HTML5 Canvas API**. All rendering and interaction logic are handled directly on the canvas to keep the project lightweight and to provide a deeper understanding of the rendering process without external library abstractions.
